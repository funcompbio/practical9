<h1 id="objectives">Objectives</h1>
<p>The learning objectives for this practical are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing R scripts</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="setup-and-background">Setup and background</h1>
<p>To do this practical you need an installation of R and RStudio. You can find the instructions in the <a href="/setup/">setup</a> link on how to install R and RStudio in your system. For a smooth development of this practical, it is strongly recommended that you follow and finish the previous <a href="/practical%208/">practical 8</a>.</p>
<p>We will download some COVID19 data to illustrate the use of R and RStudio. Please follow the next two steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Go to the Catalan Health Departament COVID19 data portal at <a href="https://dadescovid.cat" class="uri">https://dadescovid.cat</a> and switch the language to &quot;ENGLISH&quot; using the pull-down menu on the top-right corner of the page.</li>
<li>Follow the downloads link and on the next page click and download the file corresponding to the &quot;7 DAY AGGREGATION&quot; for &quot;CATALUNYA&quot;. Make sure you know exactly where in your filesystem this file has been downloaded. <strong>Tip:</strong> some browsers automatically download files into a folder called &quot;Downloads&quot; or under a name corresponding to the translation of &quot;Downloads&quot; to the default language of your operating system.</li>
<li>Make a directory in your filesystem, for instance at your <em>home</em> directory, called <code>practical 8</code> and copy in it the downloaded file.</li>
<li>Since the downloaded file is a ZIP file, uncompress as you did in <a href="/practical1/">practical 1</a> so that you finally have a file called <code>catalunya_setmanal.csv</code> in the directory <code>practical8</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are using the UPF <em>myapps</em> cloud to run RStudio, then you need to either use an internet browser in <em>myapps</em> to download the data file directly in the <em>myapps</em> cloud or upload to the <em>myapps</em> cloud the file that you have downloaded in your own computer.</p>
<h1 id="writing-r-scripts">Writing R scripts</h1>
<p>We may often use an interactive R session to quickly examine data or make some straightforward calculations. In such an interactive session, we can also recover previous instructions in the R shell by pressing the <code>upwards arrow</code> key. However, if we really want to keep track of the R commands we are using, we should write them in a text file with filename extension <code>.R</code>, which we shall refer hereafter as an <em>R script</em>.</p>
<p>There are two main ways to create an R script: (1) openining a new file with a text editor and saving it with filename that includes the <code>.R</code> extension, or (2) if we are working with RStudio, then we click on the <code>File</code> menu and select the options <code>New File</code> -&gt; <code>R Script</code>. When we do that we should be getting the RStudio window splitted in four panes, the default three ones and one additional one for the newly created R script, as shown in the captured window below.</p>
