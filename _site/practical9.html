<h1 id="objectives">Objectives</h1>
<p>The learning objectives for this practical are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing R scripts.</li>
<li>How to manipulate dates in data.</li>
<li>How to create and use factor objects.</li>
<li>How to create and use list objects.</li>
<li>Learn visualizing data in different ways.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="setup-and-background">Setup and background</h1>
<p>To do this practical you need an installation of R and RStudio. You can find the instructions in the <a href="/setup/">setup</a> link on how to install R and RStudio in your system. For a smooth development of this practical, it is strongly recommended that you follow and finish the previous <a href="/practical8/">practical 8</a>.</p>
<p>We will download some COVID19 data to illustrate the use of R and RStudio. Please follow the next two steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Go to the Catalan Health Departament COVID19 data portal at <a href="https://dadescovid.cat" class="uri">https://dadescovid.cat</a> and switch the language to &quot;ENGLISH&quot; using the pull-down menu on the top-right corner of the page.</li>
<li>Follow the downloads link and on the next page click and download the file corresponding to the &quot;7 DAY AGGREGATION&quot; for &quot;CATALUNYA&quot;. Make sure you know exactly where in your filesystem this file has been downloaded. <strong>Tip:</strong> some browsers automatically download files into a folder called &quot;Downloads&quot; or under a name corresponding to the translation of &quot;Downloads&quot; to the default language of your operating system.</li>
<li>Make a directory in your filesystem, for instance at your <em>home</em> directory, called <code>practical9</code> and copy in it the downloaded file.</li>
<li>Since the downloaded file is a ZIP file, uncompress as you did in <a href="/practical1/">practical 1</a> so that you finally have a file called <code>catalunya_setmanal.csv</code> in the directory <code>practical8</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are using the UPF <em>myapps</em> cloud to run RStudio, then you need to either use an internet browser in <em>myapps</em> to download the data file directly in the <em>myapps</em> cloud or upload to the <em>myapps</em> cloud the file that you have downloaded in your own computer.</p>
<h1 id="writing-r-scripts">Writing R scripts</h1>
<p>We may often use an interactive R session to quickly examine data or make some straightforward calculations. In such an interactive session, we can also recover previous instructions in the R shell by pressing the <code>upwards arrow</code> key. However, if we really want to keep track of the R commands we are using, we should write them in a text file with filename extension <code>.R</code>, which we shall refer hereafter as an <em>R script</em>.</p>
<p>There are two main ways to create an R script: (1) openining a new file with a text editor and saving it with filename that includes the <code>.R</code> extension, or (2) if we are working with RStudio, then we click on the <code>File</code> menu and select the options <code>New File</code> -&gt; <code>R Script</code>. When we do that we should be getting the RStudio window splitted in four panes, the default three ones and one additional one for the newly created R script, as shown in the captured window below.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="RStudioNewScript.png" />

</div>
<p>Type in the newly created R script (either with a text editor or with RStudio) the following two lines to read the CSV file downloaded in the previous section. The first line is a comment. Lines starting with the <code>#</code> symbol are comments in R.</p>
<pre><code>## read COVID19 data
dat &lt;- read.csv(&quot;catalunya_setmanal.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Now save the R script in the directory <code>practical9</code> under the filename <code>covid19analysis.R</code>.</p>
<p>To execute a specific line of an R script in RStudio you should move the cursor to that line in the pane with the script file and press the key combination <code>Ctrl+Enter</code>. Alternatively, you can also copy and paste the line from the script to the R shell, specially if you are not working with RStudio.</p>
<p>The previous line may produce an error if the current working directory of R is not pointing to the directory where the file <code>catalunya_setmanal.csv</code> is; see previous <a href="/practical8/">practical 8</a> if you need to find out how to change the working directory in R and RStudio. In general, changing the working directory should be always performed in the R shell and never include the instruction that changes the working directory in an R script. The reason is because you or somebody else may want to run that script in a different computer where the directory with the data may be called differently.</p>
<p>Add to the script <code>covid19analysis.R</code> the necessary code to obtain a new <code>data.frame</code> object including only data from the general population, i.e., excluding data from geriatric residences.</p>

<p>It has two columns with date information (<code>DATA_INI</code> and <code>DATA_FI</code>), but which are stored as string characters (more specifically <em>factors</em>). However, R provides a way to store dates as such and this has the advantage that facilitates manipulating them for analysis purposes.</p>
<p>For instance, to two transform the two columns containing date data we should use the function <code>as.Date()</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; startdate &lt;- as.Date(dat$DATA_INI)
&gt; enddate &lt;- as.Date(dat$DATA_FI)</code></pre>
<p>While R displays these objects as vectors of character strings, they do belong to a different class of objects, the class <em>Date</em>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; head(startdate)
[1] &quot;2020-11-01&quot; &quot;2020-11-01&quot; &quot;2020-11-01&quot; &quot;2020-10-31&quot; &quot;2020-10-31&quot; &quot;2020-10-31&quot;
&gt; class(startdate)

&gt; class(enddate)
[1] &quot;Date&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Having dates stored as <em>Date</em>-class objects facilitates operations on dates such as calculating time differences:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; head(enddate - startdate + 1)
Time differences in days
[1] 7 7 7 7 7 7</code></pre>
<p>or extracting the month of each date:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; m &lt;- months(startdate, abbreviate=TRUE))
&gt; head(m)
[1] &quot;Nov&quot; &quot;Nov&quot; &quot;Nov&quot; &quot;Oct&quot; &quot;Oct&quot; &quot;Oct&quot;
&gt; class(m)
[1] &quot;character&quot;</code></pre>
<p>where we have use the argument <code>abbreviate=TRUE</code> in the <code>months()</code> function to obtain a vector of equally sized character strings, which may be useful for visualization purposes.</p>
<h1 id="factors">Factors</h1>
<p>Factors in R are a class of objects that serves the purpose of storing what is known in statistics as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_variable">categorical variable</a>, which is a variable that takes values from a limited number of <em>categories</em>, also known as <em>levels</em>. So factors are pretty much like vectors of character strings, but with additional information about what are the different values that may ocurr on those vectors.</p>
<p>Not all vectors of character strings are suitable to become factors. For instance, a vector of character strings corresponding to gene identifiers tipically should not become a factor in R, because those identifiers do not represent any kind of <em>category</em> grouping observations.</p>
<p>Factors are useful, however, in the context of a statistical analysis and data visualization, involving categorical variables. To create a factor object we should call the function <code>factor()</code> giving a vector of character strings as argument. Let's consider converting the previous vector <code>m</code> of character strings to a factor.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mf &lt;- factor(m)
&gt; head(mf)
[1] Nov Nov Nov Oct Oct Oct
Levels: Apr Aug Feb Jul Jun Mar May Nov Oct Sep</code></pre>
<p>We can see that R displays factors differently to character strings, by showing the values without double quotes (<code>&quot;</code>) and providing additional information about the possible <em>levels</em> of that factor. We can access the level information from a factor object with the functions <code>levels()</code> and <code>nlevels()</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; levels(mf)
 [1] &quot;Apr&quot; &quot;Aug&quot; &quot;Feb&quot; &quot;Jul&quot; &quot;Jun&quot; &quot;Mar&quot; &quot;May&quot; &quot;Nov&quot; &quot;Oct&quot; &quot;Sep&quot;
&gt; nlevels(mf)
[1] 10</code></pre>
<p>Sometimes, we may want the levels of a factor to comprise a set of specific values or to be ordered in a specific way. This could be the case of the previous factor <code>mf</code>, where we would like for instance to have the levels corresponding to the months of the year. We can do that as follows:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mf &lt;- factor(m, levels=c(&quot;Jan&quot;, &quot;Feb&quot;, &quot;Mar&quot;, &quot;Apr&quot;, &quot;May&quot;, &quot;Jun&quot;,
                           &quot;Jul&quot;, &quot;Aug&quot;, &quot;Sep&quot;, &quot;Oct&quot;, &quot;Nov&quot;, &quot;Dec&quot;))

&gt; nlevels(mf)

<p>We can build a contingency table of the level occurrences of a factor using the function <code>table()</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; table(mf)

<p>We can see, there is no data in 2020 for the months of January (because data was not yet recorded) and December (because it was November at the time of elaborating this practical). We can remove levels of a factor for which there is no data with the function <code>droplevels()</code>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mf &lt;- droplevels(mf)
&gt; levels(mf)

<p>Add the necessary lines of code to the script <code>covid19analysis.R</code> to create a factor object with the months in which each data row was recorded in the general population, i.e., excluding data from geriatric residences. Using this factor we can easily visualize the distribution of the columns <code>R0_CONFIRMAT_M</code> (R0 basic reproduction number) and <code>IEPG_CONFIRMAT</code> (risk of outbreak) in the general population, as function of the month, calling plot with the formula notation <code>x ~ y</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; plot(datg$R0_CONFIRMAT_M ~ mf)</code></pre>
<p>where here <code>datg</code> refers to the subset of the original <code>data.frame</code> object <code>dat</code>, excluding data from geriatric residences, and <code>mf</code> refers to the factor object with the months from that subset of data. The resulting plot contains so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot">box plots</a> for each month, which allow to visualize the location of the data in terms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile">quartiles</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have obtained the plot, look up in the help page of the <code>plot()</code> function, how can you change the labels for the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> axes to a more readable label. The resulting plot should be similar to the one below.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="R0byMonth.png" />

</div>
<p>We can see that February has no data points for the column <code>R0_CONFIRMAT_M</code> despite there are data rows for that month. To find out why we do not see any data on the plot we can inspect the values of <code>R0_CONFIRMAT_M</code> for the month of February as follows:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; datg$R0_CONFIRMAT_M[mf == &quot;Feb&quot;]
[1] NA NA NA NA NA NA</code></pre>
<p>The value <code>NA</code> in R means <em>not available</em> and R treats it in a special way depending on the operation that is performing. In the case of plots, <code>NA</code> values are ignored.</p>
<p>Plot now the risk of outbreak as function of the month, can you identify the month in which this risk has increased the most? Add the two plotting instructions to the <code>covid19analysis.R</code> script.</p>
<h1 id="lists-and-implicit-looping">Lists and implicit looping</h1>
<p>Lists allow one to group values through their elements. Let's say we want to group the values of the risk of outbreak in the previous data, by the month in which the data belongs to. We can do that using the function <code>split()</code> to which we should give a first argument of the values we want to group and a second argument with the grouping factor.</p>

<p>Grouping values can be useful in data analysis when we want to examine the data separately by groups. Let's say we want to visualize the distribution of values of the risk of outbreak for the month of April and June, next to each other. We can use the function <code>hist()</code> for that purpose, creating a grid of two plotting panes using the <code>par()</code> function, as follows:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; par(mfrow=c(1, 2))
&gt; hist(iepgbymonth$Apr, xlab=&quot;Risk of outbreak&quot;, main=&quot;April&quot;)
&gt; hist(iepgbymonth$Jun, xlab=&quot;Risk of outbreak&quot;, main=&quot;June&quot;)</code></pre>
<div class="figure">
<img src="IEPGAprilJune.png" />

</div>
<p>Now, let's calculate the mean of the risk of outbreak for the month of April. Having built the previous <code>list</code> object, we can make that calculation applying the function <code>mean()</code> to the corresponding element of the list:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mean(iepgbymonth$Apr)
[1] 76.71023</code></pre>
<p>Let's say we want to compare this value with the mean value for the month of March:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mean(iepgbymonth$Mar)
[1] NA</code></pre>
<p>Here we got an <code>NA</code> value because the month of March has missing values for some weeks and, by default, the function <code>mean()</code> propagates that <code>NA</code> value to the result. We can ask the <code>mean()</code> function to exclude <code>NA</code> values and do the calculation on the non-missing ones using the argument <code>na.rm=TRUE</code>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; mean(iepgbymonth$Mar, na.rm=TRUE)
[1] 285.2916</code></pre>
<p>It would be tedious to do that calculation for each different month by writing one such function call for each element of the list. As an alternative, we could use a <code>while</code> or <code>for</code> loop that would iterate over the elements of the list. However, R provides a more compact way to iterating over lists, and other objects, by using functions for <em>implicit</em> <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#Looping">looping</a> such as <code>lapply()</code> or <code>sapply()</code>. These functions take a list as a first argument, iterate through each element of that list, and at each iteration apply the function given in the second argument. Additional arguments can be given and will be passed to the <em>applied</em> function.</p>
<p>The function <code>lapply()</code> returns again the input list with its elements replaced by the result given by the function on each corresponding element, while the function <code>sapply()</code> attempts to simplify the resulting data structure in that if each element of the resulting list has length 1, then it return an atomic vector.</p>
<p>We can calculate the mean of the risk of outbreak per month with the following call to the <code>sapply()</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; sapply(iepgbymonth, mean, na.rm=TRUE)
      Feb       Mar       Apr       May       Jun       Jul       Aug       Sep

      Oct       Nov

<p>where here the argument <code>na.rm=TRUE</code> is passed by <code>sapply()</code> to each call to the <code>mean()</code> function. Try the same call using the <code>lapply()</code> function and notice the difference in the output.</p>
